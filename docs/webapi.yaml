    get:
      summary: WebSocket endpoint
      description: |
        This endpoint is for server-side-event dispatching.

        Once connected, client must send a JSON text message of type
        `WithSig-Auth` for authentication.
        If server does not close it immediately, it means success.

        Since OAPI does not support WebSocket interface, we use request and
        response types documented here mean outgoing and incoming JSON text
        messages.
